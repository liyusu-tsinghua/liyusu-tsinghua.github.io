    "i'll show sth basic in quant's world --non-arbitradge-theory , through Convertiable Bond in Chinese market . this is also one of my homework , i hope this can help you understand the basic math structure in a quant's world . during the ilustration , i assume you hve never met this area , but you should have a basic understanding about PDE . if you just have an interest in this area and a little knowledge about math , but don't know where to start , follow me ,let's go !\n",

    "## what is arbitradge\n",
    "\n",
    "in the first beginning , i'll start from a toy-model : from today on , after a week , god drop a coin , if the coin shows upside , tesla's share price will indrease \\$100 , else the tesla's shareprice will decrease \\$100\n",
    "\n",
    "now you need to price such a chance : if tesla's share price rose , you get the money equle to the Tesla's share price , else you get 100 dollar .\n",
    "\n",
    "intuitionally , the answer is $Price(this chance) = 0.5 * (S + 100) + 0.5 * 100$ where $S$ is Tesla's share price today ; if you are mor carefully , you may modify the the fomula a little into $Price(this chance) =0.5 * (S+100) + 0.5 * \\frac{100}{1+r} $ where $r$ is the interest rate a bank would pay you if you save \\$100 in it for a week . \n",
    "\n",
    "but is taht true ? \n",
    "\n",
    "what if we sue a linear combination of tesla's share and some cash in the bank to replace that chance ? say $replace = \\alpha * S + \\beta * cash$\n",
    "\n",
    "we get :\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "replace =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\alpha * (S + 100) + \\beta * cash * (1+r) \\text{ , god's coin show upside} \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha * (S - 100) + \\beta * cash * (1+r) \\text{ , god's coin show downside }\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "let $chance = replace$ we get \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\alpha * (S + 100) + \\beta * cash * (1+r) = S + 100 \\text{ , god's coin show upside} \\\\\n",
    "\\alpha * (S - 100) + \\beta * cash * (1+r) = 100 \\text{ , god's coin show downside}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "that is to say $\\begin{cases} \\alpha = \\frac{S}{200} \\\\ \\beta = \\frac{S + 200 - S^2/100}{2*(1+r) * cash} \\end{cases}$ and $replace = \\frac{S^2}{200} + \\frac{S + 200 - S^2/100}{2*(1+r) } $ obviously that is different from our intuition answer . in fact if we use $\\phi_{up} , \\phi_{down} $ to denote $S+100 , 100$ , $S_{up} , S_{down}$ to denote $S+100,S-100$ , $ S * (1+r)$ denoted by $S_{-}$ , we have:\n",

    "\n",
    "instead of \n",

    "$\n",
    "intuition = p_{up} * \\phi_{up} +  p_{down} * \\phi_{down}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "in fact the difference between 'replace' and 'intuition' is that the replace is not influnced by the probebility of the coin showing upside . if i use the 'replace' strategy , no matter how our 'god' cheating druing the coin game , we won't lose anthing . in another world , once the price of the chance is different from the price of the $replace$ we calculate , we can meke profile with a probebility of 100% .\n",

    "\n",
    "let's observe what if 'god' droping coins every second , and each time price add or lose 0.0001 dollar . then when we observe the price in a 'day' scale , the price just like sth continous , if you know a little about wiener process , that price is just a  --denote the tenor of droping coins $\\delta t$ , the add amount $\\mu + \\Delta$ , the lose amount $\\mu - \\Delta$ , and we have :\n",
