# mi pad using experience

i changed my working mechine from a thinkpad S5 to xiaomi pad 5 pro , the thinkpad laptop has been working for me for almost 5 years , considering i don't play games , that thinkpad in fact is beyond my requirement , i install a cuda on it , based on it's RTX 960M , and try some toy model on it . however , colab nowadays can offer calculation powever much better than that mechine , which means if i just want to try some toy model , using colab is better than uesing laptop , if i need to do some serious calculation , 960M is far away from enough . i still need to rent server to do my research . so why don't change a mechine ?

i 've used xiaomipad as my working mechine for half a year , honestly speaking , this mechine can not work independently , but on the other hand , if you can connect to a server , and have a windows mechine at home , useing xiaomipad 5 pro is really a enjoyable experience

i will share some of my personal feeling when using it :

## power and charging

the most accrective point compairng with a win game-laptop , is the battery life and the charging speed . when i'm using my laptop , working away from power supply is inpossible . i can run it for 3 hours independently with hole bettary , which means , if my classroom doesn't offer power supply around the seat , i must charge it full before every class . but when i changed to this mi-pad , i just charge it after getting up , than after cleaning myself and having breakfast , i take it with me to school , till after the 10pm class , i don't charge it . i don't warry about power supply anymore , i don't bring my charger nowadays .  

that's my feeling , i use it to deal everything , from morning to midnight , without charging . personally speaking , more bettary life is useless , because charging once a day or once every 3 days all require charging during workdays . so once the bettary can support you for a whole day use , the only thing important is how long it needs to charge fully . for me during cleaning and breakfast it charged fully means i can using it play games or reading novels or doing sth else to relax my self without charging it before fall asleep , i don't need to get away from my bed to charge it and than go back to sleep . just play , sleep . charging it tomorrow morning is enough .

for specific parameters , the charging speed is 67w , the bettary contain is 8600mAh , the system tell me my 80% bettary can run 36hours now .

## the second point is weight . 

mi pad don't need charger with me , all the things i need is a keyboard and a penciel , the portective sleeve is a keyboard it's self , and the penciel use bluetooth and can be charge when attached megnetically to the pad , without requiring a charger . all this together is less than 1kg. the pure pad is just around 500g , the keyboard and penciel is around 200g? idn't know , my feeling is my backpack is not obviously havier after a put the mi-pad suit in it . but it's really heavy when i carry my laptop and it's power supply . 

## function

infact just say the two point above make no sence , because a phone nowadays can also satisfy this , but why i don't use a phone as my working mechine ? because a phone can not do some specific task , but mi-pad can do almost every thing .

### termux

android is a linux it's self , so why not use sth in linux to manage an android device ? termux is exactly what i need to use git in android . use git pull git push to easily execute file communcation is more convinous than you think . 

if you are familiar with managing your files under a linux shell , than termux can help you manage your files as if you are at a linux environment . 

i can use unzip *.zip to unzip all zip files in that filder . of course , you can install your own vim here and use it as your text editor . i'm not a vim user . so this point doesn't help me . 

sence you can use termux , you can also use a strict linux system in this pad , for example a ubuntu , by setting the start script , you can allow it access your sdcard , so that you can management your files in ubuntu . 

### ssh and browser

maybe these two are not that important , because termux means these useful , but i still want to say that these truly help me . i use ssh to nonnect a linux sevrer . my server is from alibaba , which give me a 1 year free proied . i install a jupyter notebook on it , also i have a lot of conda environment on it , so my daily developing is on cloud , i use my browser at this mi-pad to access that jupyter service . 

### vscode remote and teamviewer

the only problem remain is that vscode don't offer an android version , if you use some replace method , like code server or sth else based on web , there would be limitation using vscode remote . 

which means you can not use a local text editor on android to modify your code remote , nomatter the code is on github or your own server . 

to solve this problem , my current plan is use a teamviewer to opreat my laptop at home , and use it as my vscode server . 

### white board

till now , someone may argue that why not just use light win , a win11 superbook can achieve all the functions you mentioned before , but there is still one thing a win11 surface or supper book can not do well , the writting experience . 

for me , writting some fomula during meeting is necessary , ipad can do this , but win cannot , there is not such an app just for handwritting . 

## summary
ipad charge too slow , surface don't have enjoyable writting experience . android pad , just perfect.
